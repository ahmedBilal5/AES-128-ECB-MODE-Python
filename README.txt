This is my implementation of AES-128 ECB mode in python.

How to run the program:

1. Run the file 'AES_128.py'

2. select an option. (1 or 2)

3a. if option 1 is selected, you will have to input a 32 digit hexadecimal key and plaintext (in hexadecimal digits) of any length. The plaintext will be encrypted
    using the key and the ciphertext will be displayed. The ciphertext will then be decrypted and the plaintext will be generated back.

3b. if option 2 is selected, a random key from  'key_file.key' will be selected and a random plaintext from 'plaintext.pt' will be selected. Encyption and decryption
    will be perfomed and the encryption PLUS decryption rate in (MB/s) will be calculated.


Rate of encryption+decryption in MB/s:  0.0002566225490589818
