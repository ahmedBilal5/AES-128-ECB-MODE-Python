This is my implementation of AES-128 ECB mode in python.

How to run the program:

1. Run the file 'AES_128.py'.
2. select an option. (1 or 2)
3a. if option 1 is selected, you will have to input a 32-hex digit key and a hexadecimal plaintext of any length.
3b. if option 2 is selected, a random key from  'key_file.key' will be selected and a random plaintext from plaintext.pt will be selected encryption rate will be calculated and displayed

Rate of encryption in MB/s:  0.0002566225490589818
